## WIP senior project - Frontend

### Installation

This project was built on React 17.0.2. If Node is installed on your system, **simply running `npm start`** should start the frontend on `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Class Note

This is still very barebone and intentionally incomplete. I will be returning to this after I have figured out queueing and gapless playback.
